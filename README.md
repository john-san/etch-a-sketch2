# TOP Foundations Project #4: Etch-a-Sketch
This project's objective was to create an etch-a-sketch. 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The user can hover over the grid cells to draw images. The user has various tools they can use: color pen, gray scale pen, rainbow pen, eraser, and a clear grid option. 

The user may also increase the grid size from 16x16 up to 64x64. Lastly, the user can toggle the pen by clicking inside the grid. 

I was able to practice JavaScript, event handling, and DOM manipulation through this project. I also learned how to work with different HTML input elements such as the color picker and the range slider.
